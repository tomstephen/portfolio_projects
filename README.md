# Tom Stephen Portfolio Projects

This repo contains a few recent projects I've completed to hopefully show the breadth and qualtiy of my work.

## SMP Summer Industry Experience
Simulated flight of paraglider in real time, using Bullet Physics & OpenGL in C++. Optimised/parameterised the model, and re-implemented the physics system to be more accurate. Implemented batch testing system, and wrote some Python scripts to automate testing of various parameters.

## Numerical Simulation of Ferromagnet
Derived the physical theory for simulate a ferromagnet by considering a (1D, 2D and 3D) lattice of dipoles. Implemented and verified behaviour of monte-carlo simulations for the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm.

## Numerical Solution for Double Pendulum
Derived dyanmics of double pendulum using Langrangian mechanics. Compared different ODE solves in Matlab to solve the double pendulum system.

## n-body Gravity Simulation
Implemented n-interacting particle simulation with gravitational forces. Started with serial implementation with some basic performance improvements, then reimplemented costly sections of code (found with profiling) using CUDA to parallelise operations on GPU.
